  title: "Memory Enhanced Visual-Speech Aggregation Model for Dense Video Captioning"
  venue: Under review
  description: "Introducing a Memory Enhanced Visual-Speech Aggregation model for dense video captioning, inspired by cognitive informatics on human memory recall. The model enhances visual representations by merging them with relevant text features retrieved from a memory bank through multimodal retrieval involving transcribed speech and visual inputs."
