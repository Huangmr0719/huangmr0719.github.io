  title: "Scene Knowledge Enhanced Multimodal Retrieval Model for Dense Video Captioning"
  venue: 2025 Twenty-first International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC 2025)
  description: "Introducing a Memory Enhanced Visual-Speech Aggregation model for dense video captioning, inspired by cognitive informatics on human memory recall. The model enhances visual representations by merging them with relevant text features retrieved from a memory bank through multimodal retrieval involving transcribed speech and visual inputs."

  title: "LDIT: Pseudo-Label Noise Adaptation via Label Diffusion Transformer"
  venue: 2025 Twenty-first International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC 2025)
  description: "We reformulate label prediction as a progressive refinement process starting from an initial random guess, and propose LDiT (Label Diffusion Transformer) for pseudo-label noise adaptation. By modeling label uncertainty through a diffusion process, LDiT enables more robust learning under noisy supervision. In addition, to effectively capture the long-range dependencies in textual data, we adopt a Transformer-based latent denoising architecture with self-attention mechanisms."
